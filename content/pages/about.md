Some additional informations about this course. 


**Florence d'Alché-Buc** is a full professor at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Pari in Statistical Learning. She is the holder of the "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Digitalized Industry and Services" chair at Télécom Paris, and is mainly interested in learning from *complex* data, in particular the supervised prediction of graphs, functions and spatio-temporal signals, exploiting the structure and geometry of these objects in regularization and cost functions. More recently, she has been working on the interpretability and robustness of predictive models. [Link to personal webpage](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/fdalche/).

**Quentin Bouniot** is a Post-Doctoral researcher  at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Paris. His current research topic focus on Uncertainty and Explainability in Deep Learning models. The topic of his PhD was on Few-shot Learning and Meta-Learning more specifically applied to Object Detection and Image Segmentation. [Link to personal webpage](https://qbouniot.github.io/).
