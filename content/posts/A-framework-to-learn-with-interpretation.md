# Introduction
In recent years, the field of machine learning has witnessed a surge in the adoption of complex predictive models across various domains such as law, healthcare, and defense. With the increasing complexity of these models, the need for interpretability has become paramount to ensure trustworthiness, transparency, and accountability. Interpretability, often interchangeably used with explainability, refers to the ability of a model to provide human-understandable insights into its decision-making process. However, it is essential to distinguish between the two terms: interpretability focuses on providing insights into the decision process, while explainability involves logical explanations or causal reasoning, which often necessitate more sophisticated frameworks.

Addressing the challenge of interpreting models, especially deep neural networks, has led to the development of two main approaches: post-hoc methods and "by design" methods. Post-hoc approaches analyze pre-trained systems locally to interpret their decisions, while "interpretable by design" methods aim to integrate interpretability directly into the learning process. Each approach has its advantages and drawbacks, with post-hoc methods being criticized for computational costs and robustness issues, and interpretable systems by design facing the challenge of maintaining performance.

Taking a novel perspective on learning interpretable models, a new generic task in machine learning called Supervised Learning with Interpretation (SLI) is introduced. SLI involves jointly learning a pair of dedicated models: a predictive model and an interpreter model, to provide both interpretability and prediction accuracy. This approach acknowledges that prediction and interpretation are distinct but closely related tasks, each with its own criteria for assessment and hypothesis space. This leads to the introduction of FLINT (Framework to Learn With INTerpretation), a solution to SLI specifically designed for deep neural network classifiers.

FLINT's Key Contributions:

- FLINT presents an original interpreter network architecture based on hidden layers of the network, enabling local and global interpretability through the extraction of high-level attribute functions.
  
- A novel criterion based on entropy and sparsity is proposed to promote conciseness and diversity in the learnt attribute functions, enhancing interpretability.
  
- FLINT can be specialized for post-hoc interpretability, further extending its applicability and demonstrating promising results, as detailed in supplementary materials.

In this blog post, we delve into the significance of interpretability in machine learning systems, exploring its implications, challenges, and recent advancements introduced through FLINT. We will dissect the key concepts presented in the article and examine how FLINT addresses the pressing need for interpretable models, particularly in the context of deep neural networks. Additionally, we will discuss the potential impact of FLINT on various real-world applications and its implications for the future of transparent and trustworthy AI systems. Stay tuned for a comprehensive analysis of FLINT and its contributions to the evolving landscape of interpretable machine learning.
