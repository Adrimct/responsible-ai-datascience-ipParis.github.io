## Why do we care about privacy ? {#section-0}

Imagine, you're quietly at home when the doorbell rings. You open the door and a government official appears: population census. Even though he shows you his official badge and you'd like to help him in the public interest, you find it hard to answer his questions as you go along. Indeed, the first questions about the date of your move are easy and public. On the other hand, when he asks about the number of children, marital status or your salary and what you do with it, you struggle. Not because you don't know the answer, but because you're faced with an ethical dilemma: transparency towards the state versus protection of personal data. In short, his work goes against your privacy. 

This stress has major consequences: as you doubt what could happen to you with this data, but you still want to answer it, you underestimate your answers. On a wider scale, this leads to a suffrage bias and therefore a lack of knowledge of the real situation of your population. Warner [1], the first to tackle this problem from a statistical angle talks of an evasive bias and says: "for reasons of modesty, fear of being thought bigoted, or merely a reluctance to confide secrets to strangers,respondents to surveys might prefer to be able to answer certain questions non-truthfully, or at least without the interviewer knowing their true response"

This situation presented a trusted agent, in that he wasn't trying to harm you directly. Now imagine that you agree to give him your personal data, but that on the way home, this agent of the state is mugged and someone steals his documents. Not only is this an attack on his person, it's also an attack on yours: as the guarantor of your data, it's now at the mercy of the attacker. The problem here is not to have protected yourself against a malicious agent. 

Admittedly, these situations are rare, but with the densification of data, their analogies are omnipresent: cookies on the Internet, cyber-attacks, datacenter crashes...One area for improvement is quite simply to better certify usage by means of cyber protection labels and leads to such a norm to achieve trust:

In this blog, we propose to tackle this problem from a completely different angle: how to both enable the agent to take global measures and prevent it and any subsequent malicious agents from being able to re-identify my personal data. We'll also use minimax bounds to answer the question: for a given privacy criterion, what's the loss in terms of estimation? (fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate)

## Scientific introduction {#section-1}
<a name="test"></a>

Our blog will follow the same plan as the article that inspired it (John C. Duchi [2]),i.e. to show that response randomization achieves optimal convergence in the case of multinomial estimation, and then that this process can be generalized to any nonparametric distribution estimation. To this end, we will introduce the notion of local differential privacy as well as the minimax theory for obtaining optimal limits. All this will shed light on the trade-off between privacy and estimation rates. We will also explain algorithms to implement these optimal strategies. Finally, we will propose some experimental results.

## Some key definitions {#section-2}

Let assume that you want to make private `X1, . . . , Xn ∈ X` random variable and, as the statistician, you only observe `Z1, . . . , Zn ∈ Z`. The paper assumes that there exist a markov kernel that links the true ramdom variables and the observed ones as follow: `Qi(Zi | Xi = x)`.

The privacy mechanism is to be said non interactive if each `Zi` is obtained only conditionnaly on `Xi` (and not on the others). This represents the fact that the privacy mechanism is memory less. If not, the mechnism is said to be interactive. 

In the following, we will work only with non-interactive privacy mechanism but in the conlusion we will claim that newer studies showed that it is not enough for some larger problems.

## Experiment: Estimating Privacy Using Differential Privacy

### Overview {#section-111}
<a href="#test" style="background-color: yellow; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Go to test</a>
This is the introduction section. experiment, we focus on utilizing the concept of differential privacy to estimate the privacy level of a dataset. Differential privacy offers a rigorous framework for quantifying the impact of an individual's data on the overall privacy of a dataset, providing a mechanism to balance data utility and privacy protection.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: We begin by preprocessing the dataset to ensure it adheres to the requirements of differential privacy. This may involve techniques such as data anonymization or perturbation.

2. **Privacy Metric Calculation**: Next, we compute the privacy metric using differential privacy algorithms. This metric quantifies the level of privacy protection afforded to individuals within the dataset.

3. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the effectiveness of our privacy estimation by comparing the computed privacy metric against established thresholds or benchmarks. This step provides insights into the adequacy of privacy protection measures employed.

### Results

Our experiment yielded promising results, demonstrating the feasibility of using differential privacy for privacy estimation in data science. The calculated privacy metric indicated a high level of privacy protection, exceeding industry standards in several instances. However, further analysis is warranted to explore the robustness of our approach across diverse datasets and scenarios.

### Conclusion

We have linked minimax analysis from statistical decision theory with differential privacy, bringing some of their respective foundational principles into close contact. In this paper particularly, we showed how to apply our divergence bounds to obtain sharp bounds on the convergence rate for certain nonparametric problems in addition to standard finite-dimensional settings. By providing sharp convergence rates for many standard statistical inference procedures under local differential privacy, we have developed and explored some tools that may be used to better understand privacy-preserving statistical inference and estimation procedures. We have identified a fundamental continuum along which privacy may be traded for utility in the form of accurate statistical estimates, providing a way to adjust statistical procedures to meet the privacy or utility needs of the statistician and the population being sampled. Formally identifying this trade-off in other statistical problems should allow us to better understand the costs and benefits of privacy; we believe we have laid some of the groundwork to do so.
