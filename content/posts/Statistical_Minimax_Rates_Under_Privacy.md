## Introduction {#section-1}
<a name="test"></a>

The original motivation for providing privacy in statistical problems, first discussed by Warner [23], was that “for reasons of modesty, fear of being thought bigoted, or merely a reluctance to confide secrets to strangers,” respondents to surveys might prefer to be able to answer certain questions non-truthfully, or at least without the interviewer knowing their true response. With this motivation, Warner considered the problem of estimating the fractions of the population belonging to certain strata, which can be viewed as probability estimation within a multinomial model. In this paper, we revisit Warner’s probability estimation problem, doing so within a theoretical framework that allows us to characterize optimal estimation under constraints on privacy. We also apply our theoretical tools to a further probability estimation problem—that of nonparametric density estimation.

In the large body of research on privacy and statistical inference [e.g., 23, 14, 10, 15], a major focus has been on the problem of reducing disclosure risk: the probability that a member of a dataset can be identified given released statistics of the dataset. The literature has stopped short, however, of providing a formal treatment of disclosure risk that would permit decision-theoretic tools to be used in characterizing trade-offs between the utility of achieving privacy and the utility associated with an inferential goal. Recently, a formal treatment of disclosure risk known as “differential privacy” has been proposed and studied in the cryptography, database and theoretical computer science literatures [11, 1]. Differential privacy has strong semantic privacy guarantees that make it a good candidate for declaring a statistical procedure or data collection mechanism private, and it has been the focus of a growing body of recent work [13, 16, 24, 21, 6, 18, 8, 5, 9].

In this paper, we bring together the formal treatment of disclosure risk provided by differential privacy with the tools of minimax decision theory to provide a theoretical treatment of probability estimation under privacy constraints. Just as in classical minimax theory, we are able to provide lower bounds on the convergence rates of any estimator, in our case under a restriction to estimators that guarantee privacy. We complement these results with matching upper bounds that are achievable using computationally efficient algorithms. We thus bring classical notions of privacy, as introduced by Warner [23], into contact with differential privacy and statistical decision theory, obtaining quantitative trade-offs between privacy and statistical efficiency.

## Experiment: Estimating Privacy Using Differential Privacy

### Overview {#section-2}
<a href="#test" style="background-color: yellow; padding: 2px 5px; border-radius: 3px;">Go to test</a>
This is the introduction section. experiment, we focus on utilizing the concept of differential privacy to estimate the privacy level of a dataset. Differential privacy offers a rigorous framework for quantifying the impact of an individual's data on the overall privacy of a dataset, providing a mechanism to balance data utility and privacy protection.

### Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: We begin by preprocessing the dataset to ensure it adheres to the requirements of differential privacy. This may involve techniques such as data anonymization or perturbation.

2. **Privacy Metric Calculation**: Next, we compute the privacy metric using differential privacy algorithms. This metric quantifies the level of privacy protection afforded to individuals within the dataset.

3. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the effectiveness of our privacy estimation by comparing the computed privacy metric against established thresholds or benchmarks. This step provides insights into the adequacy of privacy protection measures employed.

### Results

Our experiment yielded promising results, demonstrating the feasibility of using differential privacy for privacy estimation in data science. The calculated privacy metric indicated a high level of privacy protection, exceeding industry standards in several instances. However, further analysis is warranted to explore the robustness of our approach across diverse datasets and scenarios.

### Conclusion

We have linked minimax analysis from statistical decision theory with differential privacy, bringing some of their respective foundational principles into close contact. In this paper particularly, we showed how to apply our divergence bounds to obtain sharp bounds on the convergence rate for certain nonparametric problems in addition to standard finite-dimensional settings. By providing sharp convergence rates for many standard statistical inference procedures under local differential privacy, we have developed and explored some tools that may be used to better understand privacy-preserving statistical inference and estimation procedures. We have identified a fundamental continuum along which privacy may be traded for utility in the form of accurate statistical estimates, providing a way to adjust statistical procedures to meet the privacy or utility needs of the statistician and the population being sampled. Formally identifying this trade-off in other statistical problems should allow us to better understand the costs and benefits of privacy; we believe we have laid some of the groundwork to do so.

By leveraging the principles of differential privacy, data scientists can gain valuable insights into the privacy implications of their analyses and foster a culture of responsible data stewardship. Stay tuned for more updates and explorations into the fascinating realm of privacy-aware data science.
